<in><b> Executive summary:</b> </in>
<p> When creating the Drone Fi-pre our main question was, "What if we could prevent wildfires before they start?"
<p>The Drone Fi-Pre is a self-sufficient design to help prevent wildfires in a specific area utilizing infrared
cameras and electronic weathering sensors. With wireless communication between the deployed
drones, we are able to continuously monitor specific regions to identify potential wildfires and predict
its path of travel. Drone Fi-Pre serves as one of the first defenses towards wildfires prevention by
aiding and coordinating the user to take action to prevent disasters.<p></p>


<br><in><b>Design and composition</b></br></in>
<p> The Drone design is inspired by the DJI MAVIC PRO which contains: </p>
<p>- HD quality camera </p>
<p>- FLIR Duo Pro R- Infrared Camera </p>

<p> The Drone will have a Base and docking station that will be composed of :</p>
<p>The Ambient Weather WS-2902C Smart Weather Station</p>
<p>-Solar panels for energy</p>
<p>-Lithium battery in case of solar power malfunction</p>
<p>-RF tag for Precision landing</p>

<br><in><b>Platform architecture</b></in></br>
<p>The platform architecture below shows the internet of things diagram for the Drone Fi-Pre.
The Internet of Things is an interconnection of devices of everyday objects that are able to send and
receive data. In the event that there has been a detection, please refer to the drone in red above,
it will relay the information to its the Base/Docking Station. The Station will then send the data
to the other drones to locate the coordinates and activate the Ambient Weather Station to measure
humidity, temperature, wind speed, and direction. After the proper conditions are met, an AI will
process the information and relay it to the user with a suggested best course of action and wildfire
data.</p><img src ="first.jpg" alt ="Workflow.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px;"><img src = "Workflow.jpg" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
<br><in><b>Workflow application </b></in></br>
<p>The workflow application above shows a more detailed step to step process of where data gets transferred to
specific components. The blue circles (circle 1, 2 and 10) indicates that there has been no detection
of a potential fire. So after deployment, it scans the region while heading to the next docking
location to maximize range and efficiency. However, when conditions are met, the circles in grey will
activate and follow the sequence. The data will be sent back to the droneâ€™s original deployed station.
The station will then relay the information to the other drones to find the exact coordinates of the
potential fire hazards and then activate the ambient weather station to get real-time data. Once all
necessary information is gathered, an AI will process the information and transfer it to the user. The
user should receive real-time visuals, AI analysis, and ambient parameters as indicated in the user
interface section.</p>
<br><in><b>User interface</b></in></br>
<p>Our team wanted a very simple user interface to display urgency to focus on wildfire prevention. Our
primary objectives are to relay real-time information and AI analysis to determine the best course
of action for fire prevention.</p>
